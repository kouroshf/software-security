•	Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
The client was Artemis Financial, a financial services company that provides investment management, financial planning, and other financial services to clients. The client wanted to address software security vulnerabilities in their financial management software that could potentially compromise their clients' sensitive information and cause reputational harm to the company.
•	What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
During the vulnerability assessment, I identified several potential security vulnerabilities in the client's software, which I communicated clearly and effectively to the client. I emphasized the importance of coding securely and the value of software security in safeguarding sensitive information and protecting the company's reputation. Software security adds value to a company's overall well-being by protecting sensitive data, maintaining customer trust, and reducing the risk of legal and financial penalties.
•	What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
One challenging aspect of the vulnerability assessment was determining the impact and severity of the identified vulnerabilities. Some vulnerabilities were more critical than others, and it was important to prioritize them based on their potential impact on the client's business operations and reputation.
•	How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
To increase layers of security, I recommended several mitigation techniques to the client, such as implementing secure coding practices, conducting regular security testing and patching, and using multi-factor authentication. In the future, I would use industry-standard vulnerability assessment tools and frameworks to assess vulnerabilities and determine which mitigation techniques to use.
•	How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To ensure the code and software application were functional and secure, I conducted extensive testing after refactoring the code to ensure that I had not introduced new vulnerabilities. I used static code analysis tools, unit testing, and integration testing to verify the functionality and security of the software application.
•	What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The resources, tools, and coding practices I used that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks include secure coding practices, static code analysis tools, and vulnerability assessment frameworks.
•	Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
From this task, I would show future employers my ability to identify and address software security vulnerabilities, my knowledge of secure coding practices and vulnerability assessment frameworks, and my experience in conducting extensive testing to ensure software functionality and security.
